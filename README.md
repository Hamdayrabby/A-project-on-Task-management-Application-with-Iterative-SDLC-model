# Comprehensive Stress-Relieving Application



## Iteration 1: Requirement gathering & analysis

- Identify key stakeholders, including potential users and experts in stress relief. In that case, potential users can be university students. For the workload they had in everyday life.

- Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Conduct thorough research through user interviews, surveys, and competitor analysis to understand user needs and expectations. This can be done by gathering every department's student data.

- Feasibility Study: Assess project feasibility regarding resources, budget, and technical constraints.




## Iteration 2: Design Design
- Create user personas based on the information gathered in the first iteration.
- Develop wireframes or prototypes to visualize the application's interface and user interactions.
- Design the database schema if the application requires data storage.
- Define the algorithms that will generate relaxation suggestions based on stress levels.

## Iteration 3: Implementation


- Develop the basic structure of the Stress-Relieving Application.
- Implement the user interface based on the design specifications.
- Write code to handle stress level input and generate relaxation suggestions.
- Implement any backend logic and database connectivity if needed.


## Iteration 4: Testing

- Perform unit testing on individual components of the application.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- Perform stress testing to evaluate the application's performance under various stress levels.
- Gather feedback from internal testers and make necessary adjustments.



## Iteration 5: Deployment

- Release the Stress-Relieving Application to a limited group of users (alpha testing).
- Monitor the application's performance and gather feedback from early users.
- Address any critical issues and make improvements as necessary.

## Iteration 6: Review

- Collect user reviews and feedback from the alpha testing phase.
- Analyze user data to identify popular features and areas for improvement.
- Make adjustments to the application based on the feedback received.

## Iteration 7: Maintenance
- Address any reported bugs or issues from the alpha testing phase.
- Implement updates to add new relaxation techniques or features.
- Prepare for a wider release (beta testing) based on the improvements made.
