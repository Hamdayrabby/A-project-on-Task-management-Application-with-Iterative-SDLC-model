### Introduction:
A comprehensive Stress-Relieving Application emerges as a simple yet powerful solution in a world buzzing with stress. This app's mission is to develop an easy-to-use, Stress-Relieving Application that adapts to user needs. Using an iterative approach, TranquilApp aims to bring calm to users' lives by staying agile and responsive. This project will follow the **Iterative SDLC method.**

### Objective:
Comprehensive Stress-Relieving Application focuses on key objectives:

- User-Centric Design: Prioritize simplicity and user-friendliness through constant feedback loops.

- Personalized Stress Management: Develop smart algorithms for personalized relaxation suggestions based on user input.

- Continuous Improvement: Embrace an iterative process to refine features, incorporate feedback, and stay updated with stress management trends.

- Reliable Deployment: Roll out the app gradually, ensuring reliability and gathering user insights for enhancements.

- Enhanced User Experience: Create a positive user experience by actively responding to feedback, refining features, and promoting mental well-being.

## Iteration 1: Requirement gathering & analysis

- Identify key stakeholders, including potential users and experts in stress relief. In that case, potential users can be university students. For the workload they had in everyday life.

- Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Conduct thorough research through user interviews, surveys, and competitor analysis to understand user needs and expectations. This can be done by gathering every department's student data.

- Feasibility Study: Assess project feasibility regarding resources, budget, and technical constraints.




## Iteration 2: Design Design
- Create user personas based on the information gathered in the first iteration.
- Develop wireframes or prototypes to visualize the application's interface and user interactions.
- Design the database schema if the application requires data storage.
- Define the algorithms that will generate relaxation suggestions based on stress levels.

## Iteration 3: Implementation


- Develop the basic structure of the Stress-Relieving Application.
- Implement the user interface based on the design specifications.
- Write code to handle stress level input and generate relaxation suggestions.
- Implement any backend logic and database connectivity if needed.


## Iteration 4: Testing

- Perform unit testing on individual components of the application.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- Perform stress testing to evaluate the application's performance under various stress levels.
- Gather feedback from internal testers and make necessary adjustments.



## Iteration 5: Deployment

- Release the Stress-Relieving Application to a limited group of users (alpha testing).
- Monitor the application's performance and gather feedback from early users.
- Address any critical issues and make improvements as necessary.

## Iteration 6: Review

- Collect user reviews and feedback from the alpha testing phase.
- Analyze user data to identify popular features and areas for improvement.
- Make adjustments to the application based on the feedback received.

## Iteration 7: Maintenance
- Address any reported bugs or issues from the alpha testing phase.
- Implement updates to add new relaxation techniques or features.
- Prepare for a wider release (beta testing) based on the improvements made.
